# Mini-quest on the "desktop".

My gift for a friend 
 The player opens windows with interactivity. The windows can be closed and dragged. 

 The "my computer" icon. This is an improvised "my computer" with a history of pages. There is a suspicious application in one of the folders.

 The "recycle bin" icon. This is where the bad files are. 

 The "gift" icon. Mini-games. You need to look for purple numbers to enter the code from a suspicious app.

The "aboba" folder. It's just a folder with photos and videos.
